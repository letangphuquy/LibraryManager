# LibraryManager

## So why this?
Maybe it can help?
Just want to tell my story 😆. Also because I don't want my efforts become completely useless junk of codes lying at one "corner" in the hard-drive (analogous to some toy you abandoned somewhere around your room or in the warehouse, so sad 😢)

## Intro
This is my project for the final exam of the 1st semester of 1st year, in the "OOP - Basic Java" course, at VKU (February 2023).

The requirements were:
- Each student implements a desktop app with GUI (using Java Swing) 
- The app connects to a relational database via JDBC. It must contain basic operations on data: "CRUD" (Create - Read - Update - Delete)
- Then each student present their own project for assessment

## Grading status
This project was graded bare A (8.5 out of 10). I expected for higher score, like 10/10 (A+) (because I devoted pretty much time and dedication to it), so I was quite disappointed that time (still remember those feelings when I remind about them 😢 )

Of course, there are some reasons:
- During the presentation session, I was quite nervous and couldn't control the flow of the conversation. It was like, I was just responding some of the teacher's questions, and when I had a chance to speak on my own, I forgot to mention some **outstanding** advantages
- The GUI doesn't look very great (simple & Metal look)
- I have a mistake during presentation: I tried to delete an entry in a main table, which was being referenced as a foreign key in a second table, so I was confused "Why didn't it deleted" and even open up the spaghetti code to debug in front of the teacher 😆

But 8.5 is not completely bad, because:
- There are some fellows, devoting even more efforts and have better products than I did (JavaFx, cooler features, ...) but still not graded so well (9/10 ?!). I mean it reminds that there's always room for improvement, and in fact there are some aspects of the project need fixing because I was just a freshman
- Remind me to improve my confidence and presentation skills

## Some main features
- To lazy to tell it right now, will add later soon ©️ ™️
